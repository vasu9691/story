Chapter Four â€“ 


The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill: White Rabbit appears again in search
 of the Duchess's gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his maidservant,
 Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them.
 Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it,
 immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his
 gardener, Bill the Lizard, to climb on the roof and go down the 
chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered
 to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn
 into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.
