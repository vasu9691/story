Chapter Three â€“ 



The Caucus Race and a Long Tale: The sea of tears becomes crowded
 with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the 
rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and 
the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them 
a very dry lecture on William the Conqueror. A dodo decides that 
the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which 
consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner.
 Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, 
unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.
