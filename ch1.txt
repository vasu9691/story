Chapter One â€“ 
Down the Rabbit Hole: Alice, a seven-year-old girl, is feeling bored 
and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister.
 She notices a talking, clothed white rabbit with a pocket watch 
run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly 
falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all 
sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit 
through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. 
She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled "DRINK ME," the 
contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which 
she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake 
labelled "EAT ME" in currants as the chapter closes.
