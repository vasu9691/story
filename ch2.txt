Chapter Two – 

The Pool of Tears: The chapter opens with Alice growing 
to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling.
 Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the
 hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, 
Alice swims through her own tears and meets a mouse, who is swimming
 as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, 
tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. 
Her opening gambit "Où est ma chatte?" (transl. "Where is my cat?"), 
however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.
